SilverStripe 3.0.0 or greater

## Documentation

This module provides a generic, consistent API for adding spam protection to 
your SilverStripe Forms. This does not provide any spam protection out of the 
box, for that, you must also download one of the spam protection 
implementations. Currently available options are:

* [Mollom](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-mollom)
* [Recaptcha](https://github.com/chillu/silverstripe-recaptcha)
* [MathSpamProtection](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-mathspamprotection)
* [Akismet](https://github.com/tractorcow/silverstripe-akismet)

As a developer you can also provide your own protector by creating a class which
implements the `SpamProtector` interface. More on that below.

## Configuring

After installing this module and a protector of your choice (i.e mollom) you'll 
need to rebuild your database through `dev/build` and set the default protector 
via SilverStripe's config system. This will update any Form instances that have
spam protection hooks with that protector.

*mysite/_config/spamprotection.yml*

	---
	name: spamprotection
	---
	FormSpamProtectionExtension:
	  default_spam_protector: MollomSpamProtector

To add spam protection to your form instance call `enableSpamProtection`.
	
	// your existing form code
	$form = new Form( .. );
	$form->enableSpamProtection();

The logic to perform the actual spam validation is controlled by each of the 
individual `SpamProtector` implementation since they each require a different 
implementation client side or server side.

### Options

`enableSpamProtection` takes a hash of optional configuration values. 

	$form->enableSpamProtection(array(
		'protector' => 'MathSpamProtector',
		'name' => 'Captcha'
	));

Options to configure are:

* `protector`: a class name string or class instance which implements  `SpamProtector`. Defaults to your 
`FormSpamProtectionExtension.default_spam_protector` value.
* `name`: The form field name argument for the Captcha. Defaults to `Catcha`.
* `title`: title of the Captcha form field. Defaults to `''`
* `insertBefore`: name of existing field to insert the spam protection field prior to
* `mapping`: an array mapping of the Form fields to the standardized list of field names.
The list of standardized fields to pass to the spam protector are:
  * title
  * body
  * contextUrl
  * contextTitle
  * authorName
  * authorMail
  * authorUrl
  * authorIp
  * authorId

Additional options may be specified, which may be used to activate implementation specific
features for the chosen spam protector. All of these options will be passed to the
protector constructor (see below).

## Defining your own `SpamProtector`

Any class that implements `SpamProtector` and the `getFormField()` method can
be set as the spam protector. The `getFormField()` method returns the 
`FormField` to be inserted into the `Form`. The `FormField` returned should be
in charge of the validation process.

    <?php
    
    class CustomSpamProtector implements SpamProtector
    {
        /**
         * List of options passed to enableSpamProtection() used to generate this protector
         * @var array
         */
        protected $options = array();
    
        public function __construct($options = array())
        {
            $this->options = $options;
        }
    
        public function getFormField($name = null, $title = null, $value = null)
        {
            // CaptchaField is a imagined class which has some functionality.
            // See silverstripe-mollom module for an example.
            return new CaptchaField($name, $title, $value);
        }
        
        public function setFieldMapping($fieldMapping) {
            // No-op
        }
    }


## Using Spam Protection with User Forms

This module provides an EditableSpamProtectionField wrapper which you can add
to your UserForm instances. After installing this module and running /dev/build
to rebuild the database, your Form Builder interface will have an option for 
`Spam Protection Field`. The type of spam protection used will be based on your 
currently selected SpamProtector instance.

## Releasing code with Spam Protection support

Spam protection is useful to provide but in some cases we do not want to require 
the developer to use spam protection. In that case, modules can provide the 
following pattern

	$form = new Form(..);

	if($form->hasExtension('FormSpamProtectionExtension')) {
		$form->enableSpamProtection();
	}
